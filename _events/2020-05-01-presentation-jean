Data-driven Log Recommendation

In this talk, I will discuss about my ongoing work on helping developers to make better decisions when
it comes to logging an enterprise system. Since this presentation is part of my Go/No-Go meeting, I'm
going to revisit the work I've done in my first year and what are my perspectives for my Ph.D. program.

Everyone is welcome to attend!
